Initialize a Git repository (if not already done):

git init

Add the folder and files to the Git repository:
Use the following command to add all the files and changes within the folder to the staging area:

git add .

The dot . after git add means "all files and changes in the current directory".

Commit the changes:
Now, commit the changes you've added to the staging area:

git commit -m "Initial Commit"


Connect to a remote repository:
Before you can push your changes, you need to link your local repository to a remote repository. This is usually done once at the beginning:


git remote add origin <remote_repository_url>


Push the changes to the remote repository:
Finally, use the following command to push the changes to the remote repository:

git push -u origin master

The -u option is used only for the first push, and it sets the default upstream branch for subsequent pushes. After the initial push, 
you can use git push to push changes in the future.
